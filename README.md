1. Introduction

In the time of digital commerce, consumers have to deal with an overwhelming number  of choices when scrolling for online products. The challenges lie behind not only the vast  amount of options, but also the complication of filtering through product classifications, user  reviews, and description. For this reason, we decided to build a Q&A Consultation  Application for E-Commerce Platforms. 

This project aims to solve this problem using Object-Oriented approach and designed  in Java language. We utilize both Traditional Information Retrieval and AI-powered  Recommendation techniques. By choosing one or more product categories, our app will collect  data from different online marketplace websites, and provide to users. This project is expected  to enhance the customersâ€™ experience in e-commerce by enabling quicker and clearer product browsing.
